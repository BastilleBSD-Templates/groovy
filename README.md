Bastille Template to create an Apache Groovy Development Jail

This template creates a development environment for groovy programming language. After
installation you need to make sure you have set a couple of variables.



These instructions describe how to install a binary distribution of Groovy.


    Set your GROOVY_HOME environment variable to the directory you unpacked the distribution.

    Add GROOVY_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable.

Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK. On OS X this is /Library/Java/Home, on other 
unixes its often /usr/java etc. If you’ve already installed tools like Ant or Maven you’ve probably already 
done this step.

You should now have Groovy installed properly. You can test this by typing the following in a command shell:

	groovysh

Which should create an interactive groovy shell where you can type Groovy statements. Or to run the Swing interactive console type:

	groovyConsole

To run a specific Groovy script type:

	groovy SomeScript
